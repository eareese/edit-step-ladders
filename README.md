This program identifies the number of words in the longest path of edit steps, as described below in the problem statement. It takes optional user input in the form of a filename for a dictionary, which is also described in the problem statement. After reading and processing either the default dictionary or a user-supplied file, a modified depth-first search algorithm is performed to pick the longest path.
